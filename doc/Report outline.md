## Title: RISC-V on FPGA
##### Subtitle: An implementation of basic single core RISC-V functionality on an FPGA using System Verilog
## Abstract
- [ ] Describe the subset of instructions implemented
- [ ] Describe the pipeline concisely
- [ ] Describe main points of friction
- [ ] Comparison to a RISC-V benchmark of some kind

## Introduction
- [ ] Describe ISA
- [ ] Describe RISC-V in comparison to other ISA
- [ ] **Main question: can this implementation compete with RISC-V benchmark?**
- [ ] Use cases if it is competitive, and maybe still if not
- [ ] Hypothesis: competitive enough to be useful
- [ ] Description of the rest of the article
## Method
- [ ] SystemVerilog
- [ ] iVerilog
- [ ] Vivado
- [ ] FPGA
- [ ] UART
- [ ] Quick description of the functionality of each module

## Results
- [ ] Will get later today
- [ ] Find a benchmark to compare to
- [ ] 
## Discussion
- [ ] Discuss the flexibility of the system, how easily you could add instructions when all of the RTL is known and simply laid out. 
- [ ] Discuss low barriers to entry both for general purpose processor and ASIPS with this methodology
- [ ] Compare the results and benchmark, and corresponding ASIC, general purpose processor

## Conclusion
- [ ] Yay or nay I guess. 
- [ ] General conclusion I think is that this is a good platform for expanding into ASIP-territory, or integrating processor into system. I think.
